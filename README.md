# COMP333-Landing-Page
This landing page was created by Carlos Munoz and Franklin Mindich as part of an excercise for the Software Engineering course at Wesleyan University. The work between the group was split 50/50. 

The file landing_page.html contains the html for the main page defined in the project. We decided to decided to make the landing page for a streaming website specifically dedicated to nature/animal movies. 

It can be previewed at:

style_sheet.css defines the style for all pages in the directory. The four webp images whos titles begin with brid names are used as sample movie posters on the home page. The image whose title begins with "earth" is used in the page contained in the iframe, map.html, which is a placeholder for an interactive map. We imagined that could be a good use for an iframe in this context because it would have promotional value for the site, but would use an application that might be external to it. The repo also includes a copyright notice, and an html placeholder for a signup page, both of which can be reached through hyperlinks in the landing page. Aside from that, the repo contains this read me and a license.
